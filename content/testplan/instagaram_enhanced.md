## 5. Test Strategy

The testing strategy employs a multi-layered approach, aligning with the principles of the testing pyramid, to ensure comprehensive coverage and efficient defect detection.

### Testing Levels

- **Unit Testing:** This forms the base of the testing pyramid, focusing on individual microservices (e.g., authentication logic, media processing modules) and isolated React Native components. These tests are fast, automated, and executed frequently by developers to verify that each small unit of code functions correctly in isolation, without dependencies on other system parts.
- **Integration Testing:** Positioned above unit tests, this level verifies the interactions between different services (ee.g., GraphQL APIs, RESTful endpoints) and the integration between services and data stores (e.g., database-CDN integration). These tests ensure that components work harmoniously when combined, streamlining data flow and handling errors effectively.
- **System Testing:** This involves end-to-end user flows, simulating complete user journeys (e.g., posting a Reel, searching for content, viewing a personalized feed). System tests validate the entire application as a cohesive unit, ensuring all integrated components function together to meet overall system requirements.
- **Acceptance Testing:** The highest level of testing, validating the system against defined user requirements and business objectives. This often involves real-world scenarios, such as verifying the real-time accuracy of Reels recommendations or the seamlessness of cross-platform sharing, to ensure the product meets stakeholder expectations.

### Testing Methods

- **Manual Testing:** Employed for aspects requiring human judgment, such as usability testing to assess intuitive navigation and user experience, and exploratory testing to discover defects not covered by automated scripts.
- **Automated Testing:** The cornerstone of the strategy, enabling rapid and repeatable validation. This includes automated regression tests to prevent new code changes from introducing regressions, performance tests to assess system scalability and responsiveness, and security tests to identify vulnerabilities.

### The Software Testing Pyramid

The testing pyramid is a conceptual framework that guides the distribution of testing efforts, advocating for a large base of fast, low-level tests and progressively fewer, more complex high-level tests. This approach optimizes for efficiency and early defect detection.

- **Unit Tests:** Form the broad base, comprising the majority of tests. They are small, fast, and verify individual functions or methods in isolation. Performed by developers, they provide immediate feedback, catching defects early in the development cycle.
- **Integration Tests:** Fewer in number than unit tests, they focus on the interactions between components or services. They are more expensive and slower but ensure data flow and communication between internal and external systems.
- **End-to-End (E2E) Tests:** At the apex, these tests simulate real user scenarios across the entire application. They are the most comprehensive but also the slowest and most expensive to maintain. QA teams typically perform these to validate the complete user experience before release.

This pyramid structure facilitates rapid feedback, reduces test duplication, and encourages modular, maintainable codebases, ensuring comprehensive test coverage without excessive focus on any single layer.
