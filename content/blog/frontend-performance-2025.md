# Frontend Performance Optimization for 2025

## Why Performance Matters
- 53% of mobile site visits are abandoned if pages take longer than 3 seconds to load
- Every 1-second delay in page load time can lead to a 7% reduction in conversions
- Core Web Vitals now directly impact search rankings

## Key Optimization Areas

### 1. JavaScript Optimization
- Code Splitting with dynamic imports
- Tree-shaking and dead code elimination
- Web Workers for CPU-intensive tasks

### 2. Image Optimization
```html
<!-- Modern image formats with fallback -->
<picture>
  <source srcset="image.avif" type="image/avif">
  <source srcset="image.webp" type="image/webp">
  <img src="image.jpg" alt="Description" loading="lazy">
</picture>
```

### 3. Font Loading Strategy
```css
/* Preload critical fonts */
@font-face {
  font-family: 'Inter';
  font-style: normal;
  font-weight: 400;
  font-display: swap;
  src: url('/fonts/inter-var.woff2') format('woff2');
}
```

## Performance Budget
| Asset Type | Budget |
|------------|--------|
| JavaScript | < 200KB |
| CSS        | < 50KB  |
| Images     | < 500KB total |
| Fonts      | < 100KB |

## Tools for Measurement
- WebPageTest
- Lighthouse
- Chrome DevTools Performance Panel

## Conclusion
Performance optimization is an ongoing process. Regular monitoring and iterative improvements are key to maintaining fast, responsive web experiences.
