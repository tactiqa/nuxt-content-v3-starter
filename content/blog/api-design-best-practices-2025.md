# Modern API Design: Best Practices for 2025

## Introduction
In today's interconnected digital landscape, well-designed APIs are the backbone of modern applications. This post explores the latest trends and best practices in API design for 2025, helping you build more robust, scalable, and developer-friendly interfaces.

## Key Principles

### 1. RESTful by Default
- **Resource-Oriented Design**: Structure your API around resources, not actions
- **Stateless Operations**: Each request should contain all necessary information
- **Standard HTTP Methods**: Use GET, POST, PUT, DELETE appropriately

### 2. API Versioning
```http
# Good
GET /api/v2/users/123

# Better (Header-based)
GET /users/123
Accept: application/vnd.yourapi.v2+json
```

### 3. Authentication & Security
- OAuth 2.1 with PKCE for web and mobile
- Rate limiting and quotas
- Comprehensive CORS policies

## Performance Considerations

### Caching Strategies
- Implement ETags and Last-Modified headers
- Consider GraphQL for complex data requirements
- Use WebSockets for real-time updates

## Documentation
- OpenAPI 3.1 for machine-readable specs
- Interactive documentation with Try-it-now features
- Code samples in multiple languages

## Conclusion
Building great APIs requires careful planning and attention to developer experience. By following these best practices, you'll create APIs that are not only functional but also a joy to work with.
