# The Day My Code Developed a Mind of Its Own

## The Bug That Wasn't There (Until It Was)

It all started on a Tuesday. Or was it a Thursday? Honestly, when you're debugging at 3 AM, days start to blend together. I was working on what I thought was a simple feature when I encountered something that made me question my entire programming existence.

```javascript
// This should work, right?
function addNumbers(a, b) {
    return a + b;
}

console.log(addNumbers(2, 2)); // 4? Nope. '22'. Wait, what?
```

## The Heisenbug Strikes Back

You know you're in for a wild ride when your code works perfectly in the console but breaks in production, or when the bug disappears the moment you try to show it to a colleague. I swear, bugs have a sixth sense for when you're being watched.

### Common Debugging Techniques I've Tried:

1. **The Classic** - `console.log('Am I even running?')`
2. **The Desperate** - Commenting out random chunks of code until it works
3. **The Magical** - Adding `// TODO: Fix this later` and hoping it resolves itself
4. **The Superstitious** - Reformatting the entire file because maybe the indentation was off
5. **The Final Resort** - Rewriting the entire feature from scratch

## The Light at the End of the Console

After what felt like an eternity (but was probably just 15 minutes), I discovered the issue. The numbers were being passed as strings. Classic JavaScript type coercion strikes again! 

```javascript
// The fix was simple, yet humbling
function addNumbers(a, b) {
    return Number(a) + Number(b);
}

console.log(addNumbers('2', '2')); // 4! Victory!
```

## Lessons Learned

1. Always check your types (thanks, TypeScript, I promise I'll use you next time)
2. Take breaks. Your future self will thank you.
3. When in doubt, turn it off and on again (applies to both computers and programmers)
4. The bug is always in the last place you look (because you stop looking after you find it)

## In Conclusion

Programming is 10% writing code and 90% figuring out why it's not working. But that moment when everything finally clicks? That's the good stuff. That's what keeps us coming back for more.

Now if you'll excuse me, I need to go fix that `// TODO` comment from three months ago...
